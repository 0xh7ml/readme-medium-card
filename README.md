Generate stylish SVG cards for your Medium articles to showcase in your GitHub README, featuring a blurred-circle design, middle content previews, and categories.

## Overview

Awesome Medium Card is a Flask-based tool that fetches your Medium articles via RSS and creates visually appealing SVG cards. Each card displays a thumbnail, title, publication date (no time), categories (e.g., `#tech #ai`), and a preview from the articleâ€™s middle content, all overlaid on a unique purple blurred-circle background.
